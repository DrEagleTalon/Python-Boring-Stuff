# Python-Boring-Stuff
Code done by me during the Course "Automate the Boring Stuff" by Al Sweigart on Udemy. 
Course Recaps and Outlines are there as well as the code taught sorted by section.

This is just a personal library for getting comfportable using GitHub and Pushing Commits and getting used to doing it by default for version control
This Repo should in no way be used by anyone for anything as its basically useless unless you want the entire course notes in one place. Which i think you can get from him anyways.
